In this project i've used YOLO (You Only Look Once) version 5 model to train my data. Also i collected datas by myself and not any published dataset have been used in this project.
#### It's possible to use the "HandGestureRecognition.ipynb" file for training other special tasks and save the weights of YOLO model

## some of the game environment screens are look like this:

Since i was a kid, i was very interested in video games and always i wanted to create a one. So this was a chance to test my abilites of coding after years of self learning
It was my first time i was creating a game and it was a very exhausting journey to learn new stuff and graphical environments.
The Hardest part was merging the YOLO output with pygame camera, So feel free to ask if you have any question
